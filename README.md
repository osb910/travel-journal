# My Travel Journal

This is a solo project based on [this figma design](https://www.figma.com/file/QG4cOExkdbIbhSfWJhs2gs/Travel-Journal) and recommended by Bob Ziroll's [React Basics course](https://scrimba.com/learn/learnreact) on Scrimba.com.

## Features

- Rendering items dynamically using the .map method and passed in props
- Fetching the images from the real Unsplash API, using useEffect along with useState
- A fully-responsive page using four media queries with a mobile-first approach
- Added the dateTime html attribute to the time element by calculating it with a helper function (for accessibility and practice).
